## Description

This repository contains a list of Misc. utilities that I developed in order to simplify working with DataStax Enterprise (DSE). They are tested out with the latest DSE 5.1 version (5.1.7 as of writing). It should work with other minor versions of DSE 5.1; but I haven't tested them out with older DSE versions such as 5.0.x or 4.8.x, even if they're relevant in these versions. Please use them at your own discretion.

The full list of utilities is as below
